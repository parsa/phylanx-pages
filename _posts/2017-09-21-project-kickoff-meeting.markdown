On August 24th and 25th the Phylanx team held our kickoff meeting at Louisiana State University. We had a productive meeting where we were able to start pinning down project details. Some of the major decisions include: formalizing the three tiered project structure, focusing on developing primitives,  and drawing up a project timeline. You can find the notes that we took at the meeting below. In addition, we captured an image of our white board which shows the result of our timeline brainstorming

Since the meeting all of our team has rapidly started contributing to the project. We now have a working repository complete with a build system, tests, and continuous integration. While there is much still to do, we are happy that the project is launching on the right foot!
