The Phylanx team is excited to announce a search for a postdoctoral researcher
to help us to take our project’s development to the next level! We are now
entering the sixth month of work and we find ourselves in need of more hands to
continue our explosive rate of development. We are looking for a team member
with strong C++ skills and experience and an interest in high performance
computing, runtime systems, or machine learning. Familiarity with the paradigms
and constructs of modern C++ is preferred. You can read more about the
qualifications and apply for the position on [LSU’s Careers
Portal](https://lsu.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/LSU/job/LSU---Baton-Rouge/Postdoctoral-Researcher_R00019614-1).

We would be happy to talk with you about the opportunity via email at
[contact@stellar-group.org](mailto:contact@stellar-group.org)

Make a difference — join the team!
