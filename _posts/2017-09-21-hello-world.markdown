The Phylanx team is excited to start communicating our vision, research, and results of this project to the broader community. We believe that our ideas have the ability to influence the way that domain scientist utilize HPC resources. It is essential, therefore, to spread our message and include them in our work as early as possible . We hope that this platform will help us accomplish this goal. We plan to post regular updates about the project as well as elaborate on certain features of the code. In this way, we can complement the technical documentation provided in our [GitHub] repository with a more verbose and narrative driven format. Please feel free to comment and do not hesitate to reach out to us with questions or other inquiries.
